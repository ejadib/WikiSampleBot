# Wiki Sample Bot

A bot showing how to use QnAMaker to create a wiki from any channel!

It uses the [QnAMaker API](https://qnamaker.ai/Documentation/ApiReference) to query the KB for answers and to add the new Question/Answer pair provided by the users.

When running in Slack, it takes advantage of the [interactive messages](https://api.slack.com/docs/message-buttons) feature.
